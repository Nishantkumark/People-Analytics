# People-Analytics Churn Analysis and Prediction
Predicting employee turnover using Machine learning

Employee turnover results in huge loss to organizations. There are direct costs associated such as training expenses for an employee, the time taken for a new employee to start till they become a productive member. Also, there are several indirect costs that are associated with this problem as well. When an employee quits new product ideas are lost, great project managementis lost and customer relationships are lost. When high performing employees leave an organization the company can become a mediocre company. It is important to identify factors that lead to employee turnover so that high performing employees are retained.

#Data Used ----
The dataset is from IBM Watson case study which is based on an Employee dataset. 

#Techniques Used ----
We have used advanced techniques in Machine Learning such as Automated Machine learning in H2O(h2o,automl()) such as  Stacked Ensemble model, Decision Trees, XGBoost, Gradient Boosted Models, Deep Learning, Random Forests, Logistic Regression. It helps us achieve predictive performance better than traditional and commercial algorithms. 

With the help of these advancements in data science it is possible to predict employee attrition and also understand key factors that influence turnover.

Feature Importance with LIME package: It is nearly impossible to understand the deep learning algorthm because of its complexity. Now the best aand complex models such as deep learning can be investigated and be potentially understood as to what makes a model work well.
